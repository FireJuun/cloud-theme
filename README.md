# Cloud Theme

Technically, this is a direct port of the 'Cloud with 'Chris' theme, available under the MIT license, and modified to be less 'cloud' and more 'pond'.

Thanks to Chris Reddington for his excellent work.

This repo was created by 'splitting' the theme from the original [Cloud with Chris](https://github.com/chrisreddington/cloudwithchris.com) repository, following [these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/splitting-a-subfolder-out-into-a-new-repository).
